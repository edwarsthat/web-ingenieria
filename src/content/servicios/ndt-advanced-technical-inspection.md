## NDT & Advanced Technical Inspection

### Value Proposition

Industrial assets subjected to pressure, temperature, cyclic loads, or corrosive environments develop internal discontinuities that are not visible during normal operation. Defective welds, fatigue cracks, wall loss from corrosion, or undetected thermal deformation, if not identified in time, can lead to catastrophic failure, unplanned shutdown, or regulatory non-compliance.

This service provides the technical evidence needed to determine the actual integrity state of an asset, using non-destructive testing and specialized inspection methods that do not interrupt operation and generate objective data for maintenance, replacement, or certification decisions.

### Service Scope

- Qualified visual inspection (VT) per API, ASME, or equivalent standards
- Industrial ultrasound (UT): wall thickness measurement, internal discontinuity detection, phased array
- Liquid penetrant (PT) and magnetic particle (MT) testing for surface and near-surface discontinuities
- Active and passive infrared thermography for thermal integrity assessment and hot spot detection
- Industrial radiography (RT) for welded joints and critical components
- Acoustic emission for structural monitoring under load
- Welded joint evaluation under ASME IX, AWS D1.1, and equivalent codes
- Technical integrity reports with acceptance criteria and prioritized action recommendations

---

### Key Benefits

- Reduced unplanned shutdowns by detecting failure conditions before they occur
- Technical risk mitigation with objective evidence of the actual asset condition
- Energy optimization by identifying thermal losses in equipment and insulation through thermography
- Protection of the client's margin by avoiding premature replacements without technical justification or incorrect repairs
- Verifiable regulatory compliance with traceable inspection reports signed by personnel certified under ASNT or SNT-TC-1A standards

### Work Methodology

1. **Inspection scope definition**: identification of assets, critical zones, discontinuities of interest, and applicable reference standards.
2. **Method selection**: choice of the NDT technique or combination of techniques best suited to the material type, geometry, and operating condition.
3. **Surface preparation and test conditions**: verification of pre-test requirements to ensure reliable results.
4. **Test execution**: application of the selected technique by qualified personnel, with systematic recording of findings.
5. **Results evaluation**: interpretation of indications against the acceptance criteria of the applicable standard.
6. **Technical report**: formal document including methodology, results, supporting images, acceptance criteria, and prioritized action recommendations.

### Target Sectors

- Energy generation (boilers, pressure vessels, steam piping, heat exchangers)
- Metalworking industry (weld verification, structural components, fabricated equipment)
- Infrastructure (storage tanks, metallic structures, industrial bridges)
- Mining sector (process equipment, support structures, hydraulic and pneumatic systems)
- High energy-consumption industries (furnaces, heat exchangers, steam and condensate systems)

---

### Technical Differentiation

This service operates as the **Verification** pillar within the **Design + Control + Verification** model.

Advanced technical inspection is not a final procedural step — it is the objective validation that an asset was designed, fabricated, and assembled in accordance with established criteria, and that its current integrity condition is consistent with operational requirements. When the same organization participates in the design and supervision of an asset, inspection is more efficient because acceptance criteria are known from the project's origin.

---

### Expected Results

- Updated integrity map of critical assets
- Maintenance or replacement decisions backed by technical evidence, not estimates
- Reduced unplanned failure events with impact on production or safety
- Inspection technical documentation available for regulatory or insurer audits
- Technically justified service life extension for assets that still meet integrity criteria
