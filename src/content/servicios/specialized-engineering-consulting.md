## Specialized Engineering Consulting

### Value Proposition

Industrial projects fail more often at the engineering stage than during execution. Incomplete specifications, calculation reports without normative backing, and designs that ignore real operating conditions generate costly rework, delays, and avoidable technical risks.

This service addresses that problem by delivering mechanical and thermal engineering developed with normative criteria, fully traceable and oriented toward real execution. The result is technical documentation that can be taken directly to fabrication, assembly, or audit without ambiguity.

---

### Service Scope

- Development of mechanical and thermal calculation reports under applicable standards (ASME, ASTM, ISO)
- Design of piping systems, support structures, pressure vessels, and heat transfer systems
- Technical specifications for materials, equipment, and components
- Basic and detailed engineering drawings
- Review and validation of third-party engineering
- Energy efficiency analysis of existing systems
- Conceptualization and sizing of new projects
- Technical criteria and selection support for equipment procurement

---

### Key Benefits

- Reduced rework from incomplete specifications or incorrect sizing
- Technical risk mitigation from the design stage, before committing investment in materials or fabrication
- Energy optimization integrated into the design, not applied as a correction after the fact
- Protection of the client's margin by preventing cost overruns caused by engineering errors
- Verifiable regulatory compliance, with documentation ready for technical or regulatory audit

### Work Methodology

1. **Operating conditions survey**: collection of real parameters, space constraints, fluids, pressures, temperatures, and standards applicable to the project.
2. **Initial technical assessment**: evaluation of the current state (if applicable) or the scope of new engineering required.
3. **Engineering development**: calculations, sizing, material selection, and generation of technical documentation.
4. **Internal review and normative validation**: verification of compliance against applicable standards before issuance.
5. **Technical delivery**: complete engineering package including calculation reports, drawings, and specifications, with traceability of design criteria.
6. **Execution support** (when required): technical assistance during fabrication or assembly to resolve queries arising from the design.

### Target Sectors

- Energy generation (thermal, solar, cogeneration)
- Metalworking and process manufacturing industry
- Industrial infrastructure and expansion projects
- Mining sector (processing plants, transport and cooling systems)
- High energy-consumption industries requiring thermal system optimization

---

### Technical Differentiation

This service operates as the **Design** pillar within the **Design + Control + Verification** model.

Well-developed engineering does not only define what to build — it establishes the control criteria that will allow proper supervision of execution and the parameters that must be verified at the end. Consulting deliverables are designed so that supervision and inspection services can operate with objective and traceable criteria from the outset.

---

### Expected Results

- Complete, coherent, and executable technical documentation
- Measurable reduction in queries and non-conformities during the execution phase
- Engineering database reusable for maintenance, expansions, or future audits
- Greater cost control by identifying critical project variables at the design stage
